# Advanced-Lane-Detection-using-CV
Using CV techniques in Python, the project identifies road lane lines for
autonomous vehicles alongside generating a bird's eye view along with the Region of Interest frame. 
It takes a video file as an input, applies multiple image processing techniques, and returns a video with
highlighted lanes with multiple frames.
